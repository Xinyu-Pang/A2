<Task> Integrate the latest solved task (q_i) with the existing abstraction (a_{i-1}) to refine a new abstraction (a_i). The new abstraction contain information from all previous tasks and are hierarchically organized.

<Abstraction Requirements> 
1. Hierarchical: The abstractions should be multi-layered. Higher-level abstractions should represent lower-level ones while ignoring irrelevant details. The structure and layer depth should be dynamically adjusted.
2. Comprehensive: (a_i) should encapsulate patterns from all tasks, balancing task-specific details (in lower-level abstractions) and general principles (in higher-level abstractions).

<Task Format> The extracted abstractions should follow this format: {Operation_type} [{element_id}] {Operation_value} ([{element_type} {element_content} -> {Operation_type}]). If the Operation_type is CLICK, then {Operation_value} should not be included.

<Example> Combining the existing abstraction (a_{i-1}) and the last solved task (q_i) to identify representative patterns, organize them hierarchically, and ensure varying levels of abstractions reflect increasing generality.
